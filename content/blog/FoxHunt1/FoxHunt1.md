* The Fox Hunt begins at 3:00 PM.
* Dudley KD0NMD will commence automated transmissions from a hidden fox at that time.
* Listen to the BARC repeater for an announcement, with details (including frequency), when the hunt begins.
  * Dudley KD0NMD noted earlier that it's likely to be 146.565
* The fox will be hidden within [these boundaries](https://maps.app.goo.gl/itYCqbu6boDgnZk28):
  * N: L Street
  * S: Cornhusker Rd. excluding Offutt but extending past the base
  * W: 84th Street
  * E: The river
* Those who wish to do so are welcome to operate independently, from any convenient starting point.  Please use the repeater to make this a collaborative effort, keeping others informed about your progress, providing latitude, longitude, and bearing for any reading you take that seems to have promise (that is, which you don't suspect may be a reflection).
* For those who would like to participate as part of a group, we will be meeting in a [south parking lot of the Indian Hill School on W Street, between 30th and 32nd, where you'll see a sign that begins with the word "Educare"](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4r9YP5986KMnKQrE6).  I'll arrive there about 2:00 PM, eager to share my limited knowledge about how to do fox hunting with anyone who'd like to come early.  If you're an experienced fox hunter, please consider joining our group to help fox hunting newcomers learn.  Once the Fox Hunt begins at 3:00 PM, we will take some bearings, then decide whether to proceed to the next location as a group, or in smaller teams.
* We'll gather at some nearby eatery, announced on the repeater, after everyone has found the fox.
