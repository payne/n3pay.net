I enjoy these NETs.  I wish I attended them more regularly:

[NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_net) is HAM radio speak for a meeting.  Hi hi!
A NET is a great way to practice using your radio and get to know people.

Here's a list of NETs are two local VHF repeaters that I'm trying to attend regularly.  There are a lot more NETs than just these.

| Sunday 9 pm  | K0USA | Very brief ARES NET  |
| Monday 8 pm  | W0WYV | Wonderful hour of getting to know people   |
| Monday 9 pm  | K0USA | Norm runs a terrific NET |
| Tuesday 8 pm | W0WYV | Tech NET is mostly on zoom, sometimes starts on the repeater |
