Putting an antenna atop a speaker stand is an idea I learned from folks in [BARC](/clubs/barc/).

![Nice mounting for the antenna on the speaker stand](SpeakerMast_2025-11-05.jpg).  This uses 
[Dual Antenna Mast Clamp](https://a.co/d/a8QMzio) and [Hooshing Wing Nuts](https://a.co/d/6t3cklL).


I'm very pleased that I can reach the Bellevue repeater from my house using this.  I've not yet tested this on a day with bad weather.

The setup is not small, but it fits in my small 2011 Ford Ranger:
