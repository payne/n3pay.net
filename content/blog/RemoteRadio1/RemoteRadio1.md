Finally got around to playing through the instructions at [Remote.Radio](https://Remote.Radio).  It's a well written website.

Tonight I'll attend the 8 pm BARC net with this setup:

One of my Elmers (suggested making VDelay almost a second) and now things are working swell.   My specific setup is:

```
FT-991A <<<---- USB --->>> Win 11 Pro <<<--- TCP --->>> M1 Mac Mini
```

Win4Yaesu for nice GUI with CAT control $60 one time cost,
RustDesk for remote control -- free,
Mumble for audio -- free,
In the next few days I'll start using a private Mumble server for $10 / year,

I'm able to attend my first NET with this setup and I think it might work great.   I hope to discuss it during the 2025 December 2 BARC TechNet.
