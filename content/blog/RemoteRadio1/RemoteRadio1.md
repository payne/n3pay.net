Finally got around to playing through the instructions at [Remote.Radio](https://Remote.Radio).  It's a well written website.

Tonight I'll attend the 8 pm BARC net with this setup:

One of my Elmers (suggested making VDelay almost a second) and now things are working swell.   My specific setup is:

```
FT-991A <<<---- USB --->>> Win 11 Pro <<<--- TCP --->>> M1 Mac Mini
```

The FT-991A and Win 11 Pro computer are in my cold garage.  My M1 Mac Mini is in my warm basement office.   In the coming weeks I hope to invite select HAM radio friends to try operating my FT-991A with this setup.

1. Win4Yaesu for nice GUI with CAT control $60 one time cost,
2. RustDesk for remote control -- free,
3. Mumble for audio -- free,
4. In the next few days I'll start using a private Mumble server for $10 / year ( mumble is open source and could be self hosted )

I'm able to attend my first NET with this setup and I think it might work great.   I hope to discuss it during the 2025 December 2 BARC TechNet.
