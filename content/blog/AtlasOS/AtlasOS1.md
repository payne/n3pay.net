I'm liking the [AtlasOS](https://atlasos.net/) configuration of Windows 11 pro.  Many thanks to Steve [KM9G](https://www.qrz.com/db/KM9G) and his [YouTube channel Temporarily Offline](https://www.youtube.com/@temporarilyoffline) for his [introduction to AtlasOS.net](https://youtu.be/J6USamZCvGM?si=eZPmjKPNrJlb2BBY).

I've been running it on a two computers for a bit and am installing on my new GMKtec 32G 2T computer today.
