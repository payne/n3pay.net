Soon, I hope to build a yagi for radio direction finding (RDF) -- aka fox hunting.

I'll likely use the write up from K4TMN ["Constructing a Tape Measure Yagi Antenna For Hidden Transmitter Hunting or Fox-Hunting"](http://www.ccars.org/projects/TapeYagi/Yagi1/index.htm).

I'm also aware of [KB9VBR's tutorial Yagi Build on YouTube](https://youtu.be/BmHoQrDfw-0?si=hOp7C32GpUW9v-0D) that has
[worked well for people](https://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/comments/ej92s7/vhf_yagi_antenna_followed_the_instructions_by/).
