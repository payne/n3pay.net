I'm excited about [RibbitRadio.org](https://www.ribbitradio.org/) and Rattlegram.  This post will collect some notes about this ARRL Technical Innovation Award Winner (2023).

For the BARC TechNet on 11/18/2025 here are some links I'll be asking people to try out sending and receiving Rattlegrams.  Hopefully I can just share the link to this post on [HAM.live](https://ham.live) and then people can click on whatever they want to dive into.   During the NET I hope people will take turns sending and receiving messages so we can experiment, learn, and have fun as a group.
