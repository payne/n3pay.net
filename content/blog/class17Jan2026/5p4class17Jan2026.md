## Section 5.4 Power Supplies and Batteries (slides 91-104)





Here is the table of terms used in **Section 5.4: Power Supplies and Batteries** (slides 91 through 104) of the Tech Module 5 PDF.

| Term | Definition / Key Characteristics | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Power Supply** | A device that converts AC input power to DC current for radio equipment. Ratings include output voltage and continuous current supply capabilities. | |
| **13.8 Volts** | The standard operating voltage for most mobile HF, VHF, and UHF transceivers (simulating a vehicle's electrical system while running). |, |
| **Regulated Power Supply** | A power supply that uses a circuit to minimize voltage changes (sag) as the amount of current drawn by the radio changes. |, |
| **Voltage Drop** | A reduction in voltage at the radio caused by resistance in the power wires ($V = I \times R$). It is minimized by using short, heavy-gauge wire. |, |
| **Fuse** | A safety device used to prevent overheating and fire. In mobile installations, fuses should be placed in both the positive and negative leads. | |
| **Grommet** | A protective ring used to protect wiring from chafing or rubbing against exposed metal in vehicle installations. | |
| **Battery** | An electrochemical power source made up of one or more cells. | |
| **Ampere-hours (Ah)** | The energy rating unit for a battery. It is used to calculate operating time (Capacity in Ah / Current Draw in Amps = Hours). |, |
| **Storage Battery** | Large rechargeable batteries (typically lead-acid) used for emergency power. They contain strong acids and can release flammable hydrogen gas. | |
| **Lead-acid** | A common rechargeable battery chemistry used in storage batteries. |, |
| **Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH)** | A common type of rechargeable consumer battery (e.g., AA, AAA). |, |
| **Lithium-ion (Li-ion)** | A rechargeable battery chemistry commonly used in battery packs. |, |
| **Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd)** | A rechargeable battery chemistry. |, |
| **Carbon-Zinc** | A disposable (non-rechargeable) battery chemistry. |, |
| **Alkaline** | A common disposable (non-rechargeable) battery chemistry. | |
