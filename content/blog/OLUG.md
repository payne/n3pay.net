The Omaha Linux Users Group ([OLUG.org](http://OLUG.org)) is a friendly group.
[Meetings are the first Tuesday of most months](https://www.olug.org/about/). Many meetings are in person at the [AIM Brain Exchange, 1902 Howard Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BNSKefKu3Qho3MrVA).  Frequently the meetings are also streamed online with google meet so that remote people can participate in the meetings.  IMHO in person is better, and I'm grateful for online when the weather is bad or life is chaotic.

OLUG also has a nice discord server and mailing list.  Please email N3PAY@ARRL.net if you have questions.
