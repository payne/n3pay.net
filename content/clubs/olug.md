# Omaha Linux Users Group (OLUG)

The Omaha Linux Users Group ([OLUG.org](http://OLUG.org)) is a friendly group.

## Meeting Information

[Meetings are the first Tuesday of most months](https://www.olug.org/about/). Many meetings are held in person at the [AIM Brain Exchange, 1902 Howard Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BNSKefKu3Qho3MrVA). 

Frequently the meetings are also streamed online with Google Meet so that remote people can participate. In-person attendance is encouraged when possible, with online participation available for bad weather or busy schedules.

## Communication

OLUG has a nice Discord server and mailing list. 

Please email N3PAY@ARRL.net if you have questions.
